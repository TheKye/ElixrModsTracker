### Please Note! Posts that don't follow the posting formats may be closed instantly as they may be to hard for us to follow or get a good idea on and while we do this in our free time it is difficult for us to spend time trying to get the information we need to fix the problem


## Issue Posting

When Reporting an Issue Please check to see if the issue already exists, if it does but you have some new information feel free to post on the existing issue

If you feel an issue is not resolved and was closed feel free to repost with [Unresolved] In the Title

Now for issue Posting itself! To help us better understand your issue please only post in english as we only speak english! (Terribly sorry about that!) 

### Posting Format:

Type: Graphical, Crash, Functionality, Balance

Eco Version: IE: 9.3.2 ( please give us the exact version to make support easier)

Issue: Short Description of the actual Issue

How To Reproduce (if nessecary): if you do x then x then x it causes item x to behave like x (x is just a placeholder and this is just an example)

Screen Shot (where applicable): If able please provide a screen shot of the issue

Server Log (where applicable): If you have access to the server logs please post it if its due to a Server Crash

Client Log (where applicable): When you crash as a client ( get booted to the main screen with an error) please click the copy button and post the log here in a txt file

If requested for a specific json file you will be given a discord username to send it too as it may contain sensitive information

## Feature Requests

When posting feature requests you can post this as plain text, just write out the feature/addition you would like to see added to Elixr Mods, 

i guess you should specify wich module you would like to see the addition too or maybe a new one

## Balances

When you post a Balance Request there is some information we would like you to supply to give us an understanding on why you think its needed, an idea on how the balance will affect the 
gameplay and the module overall

if you have multiple balances to propose please post an issue per Module, ie: EM Food Module, But if there is multiple items in that module you would like too suggest balance for 
post them in the same post kinda like so:

### Posting Format

Item For Balance: IE: Shipping Container

Balance Proposal: this item needs a default adjustment to the Recipe, i feel its too cheap for its value and removes the need for any other storage items

(Recipe adjustment)

Old Recipe: x Item, x Item

Proposed New Recipe: x Item, x Item

(Functionality Adjustment)

Old Functionality: 

Proposed New Functionality:

Etc

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/github_username/repo_name/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
